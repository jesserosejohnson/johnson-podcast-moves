# Common moves in podcasting

## Genre: News

#### The Daily, 2/23-2/24

#### Second Podcast, Dates

### Organization

##### Introduction

- The Daily opens with an introduction of the source/host of the podcast (The New York Times), the speaker (Michael Barbaro), the name of the podcast itself, and a brief overview of the main topics Barbaro plans to cover during the episode.

##### Body

- The body of The Daily podcast takes up most of each episode and is divided into two segments by the commercial break. Each segment addresses a different topic.

##### Commercial breaks

- The Daily broke for its one commercial each episode with "we'll be right back." It was always slightly more than halfway through the podcast.

##### Conclusion

- Each episode of The Daily closed with two to three minutes of other current events that were not covered in the episode.
- At the very end of The Daily, Barbaro listed everyone involved in the production of the podcast.

### Style

##### Music

- Background music (a "theme song" for the podcast, I believe) plays during each of Barbaro's opening segments.
- Music played as The Daily went to commercial.
- At some points, particularly when Barbaro was monologuing, background music played during the body of The Daily.
- The theme music returned again and played throughout the entire conclusion of The Daily.

##### FX

- Throughout each episode of The Daily, audio from current events (such as CPAC or events in Iraq) or movies (like Moonlight) was played during the interviews. There was very little division between the audio and the interview; at times they even overlapped.

### Narrative types

##### Interviews

- The Daily was very journalistic, as expected: Barbaro introduces and interviews guests. There are sections where Barbaro plays audio from current events, but the majority of his podcasts are composed of interviews.
- The interviews on The Daily were more formal when covering political topics, and more like discussions when talking about other things.
