# Common moves in podcasting

## Genre: News & Politics

#### The Daily (Michael Barbaro, The New York Times) - 2/23-2/24

#### Can He Do That? (Allison Michaels, The Washington Post) - 2/17, 2/24

### Organization

##### Introduction

- The Daily opens with an introduction of the source/host of the podcast (The New York Times), the speaker (Michael Barbaro), the name of the podcast itself, and a brief overview of the main topics Barbaro plans to cover during the episode.
- Can He Do That? opens very similarly, just in a slightly different order. First the title of the podcast is given, then a summary of the podcast's topics, and finally the name of the host (Allison Michaels) and her first guest. The only thing Michaels doesn't mention that Barbaro does is the source/host of her podcast, The Washington Post.

##### Body

- The body of The Daily podcast takes up most of each episode and is divided into two segments by the commercial break. Each segment addresses a different topic.
- On the other hand, Can He Do That? focuses on one topic for each episode, and Michaels brings in various guests to interview and speak with about that topic (Trump's tax returns on 2/17, and Trump's business ties on 2/24).
- Can He Do That? has a longer running time that is most apparent when comparing the bodies of both: 25-29 minutes compared to The Daily's approximately 15 minute running time (not including The Daily's commercial break, which takes up 4-5 minutes).
- The Daily is, obviously, a daily podcast, while Can He Do That? is published weekly. However, Michaels' topic is much narrower than Barbaro's; she covers exclusively Trump, while Barbaro discusses a much broader range of subjects, from the situation with ISIS in Iraq to the Oscar-nominated movie, Moonlight.

##### Commercial breaks

- The Daily broke for its one commercial each episode with "we'll be right back." It was always slightly more than halfway through the podcast.
- Can He Do That? did not have any commercial breaks. However, at the beginning of each episode, a sponsor is briefly mentioned.

##### Conclusion

- Each episode of The Daily closed with two to three minutes of other current events that were not covered in the episode. No guests were involved in this part of the podcast.
- At the very end of The Daily, Barbaro listed everyone involved in the production of the podcast.
- Can He Do That? ends with Michaels asking her interviewee a few "rapid fire" questions as the episode winds down. These are much briefer than their discussions earlier in the episode. She then thanks her guest, gives Twitter handles and websites, and a mention of what she intends to discuss next week.
- As expected, each episode of Can He Do That? ends with a list of the production team.

### Style

##### Music

- Background music (a "theme song" for the podcast, I believe) plays during each of Barbaro's opening segments.
- Music played as The Daily went to commercial.
- At a few points, particularly when Barbaro was monologuing, background music played during the body of The Daily.
- The theme music returned again and played throughout the entire conclusion of The Daily.
- Can He Do That? has its own theme music that plays throughout the introduction.
- Unlike The Daily, Can He Do That?'s theme music returns to clearly mark the divisions between different interviews and segments of each podcast. It begins softly, swells up, and then subsides again as the new segment begins.

##### FX

- Throughout each episode of The Daily, audio from current events (such as CPAC or events in Iraq) or movies (like Moonlight) was played during the interviews. There was very little division between the audio and the interview; at times they even overlapped.
- Rather than including audio, Michaels usually read off quotes during her interviews. She did, at a few points, include other, previously taped interviews in order to go more in depth. These were phone interviews and seemed to be lower quality than the rest of the podcast, as the phone static was audible at some points.
- On a couple of occasions, Can He Do That? does use brief audio of things such as Trump's quotes.

### Narrative types

##### Interviews

- The Daily was very journalistic, as expected: Barbaro introduces and interviews guests. There are sections where Barbaro plays audio from current events, but the majority of his podcasts are composed of interviews.
- The interviews on The Daily were more formal when covering political topics, and more like discussions when talking about other things.
- Can He Do That? is also in interview format, but overall seems slightly more formal than The Daily at certain points, likely because it has a more specific focus that requires a continuous level of formality.
